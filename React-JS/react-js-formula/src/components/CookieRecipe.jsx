          Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with
          parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, cream together 1 cup (2
          sticks) of softened unsalted butter and 1 cup of packed brown sugar
          until light and fluffy. Add in 2 large eggs, one at a time, beating
          well after each addition. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 leading-relaxed">
          In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose
          flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
          Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until
          just combined. Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips or chunks.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4 leading-relaxed">
          Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet,
          leaving enough space between each cookie. Bake in the preheated oven
          for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the
          cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before
          transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your
          homemade classic chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk!
